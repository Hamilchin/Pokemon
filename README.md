# Pokemon
CS1B Pokemon Project.

A fully functioning ascii version of pokemon, complete with extra features: ascii banners and an animation, proper scaling of stats based on level using property decorators, an additional mechanic in pokemon called same type attack bonus (STAB), better exp scaling, changing level of wild pokemon to range between 1 and highest leveled pokemon + 4 so that the levels of opponents scale with the level of your pokemon, and making turn order more accurate to how it should work in pokemon (instead of alternating, each player chooses their move at the same time and they happen in order of speed each turn)

Additional notes: Pok√©dex class has been renamed to Team, and there is no update_level method because we made level a property instead
